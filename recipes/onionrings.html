        These air fryer onion rings are better for you than their deep-fried counterparts! They're battered and breaded, then air-fried to crispy perfection.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All-purpose Flour</li>
        <li>Cornstarch</li>
        <li>Baking powder</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>onion</li>
        <li>milk</li>
        <li>egg</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>garlic powder</li>
        <li>paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt together in a small bowl. Dip onion rings into the flour mixture until coated, then place onto a plate.        </li>
        <li>Stir milk and egg into the remaining flour mixture using a fork. Dip the floured rings into the batter to coat. Place onto a wire rack until the batter stops dripping.</li>
        <li>Place bread crumbs into a shallow dish. Place rings, one at a time, into bread crumbs, scooping crumbs over the top until evenly coated. Give rings a hard tap as you remove them from the crumbs; the coating should cling very well.</li>
        <li>Heat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Place rings into the air fryer basket so they are side-by-side without overlapping; spray lightly with cooking spray, then flip rings.</li>
        <li>Place the basket into the air fryer and cook until rings are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, flipping once halfway through. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with garlic powder and paprika.Place the basket into the air fryer and cook until rings are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, flipping once halfway through.
